# Express_Calculator

This is a simple Express.js application that performs basic statistical operations on a set of numbers provided via query parameters. The app supports three main operations: Mean (average) Median (midpoint) Mode (most frequent number) Each operation is available via separate routes (/mean, /median, and /mode), and the results are returned as JSON responses. The app also handles errors such as invalid inputs and missing numbers.

#Features:
Perform mean, median, and mode calculations via GET requests.
Handles invalid numbers and empty inputs with clear error messages and a 400 Bad Request response.
/all route to compute all three operations at once.
Optional save parameter to save results to a file with a timestamp.
Honors the Accept header to return results as JSON or HTML based on the clientâ€™s request.
Further Enhancements:
Unit tests for all statistical operations.
Extensible to add more statistical functions or features.
This project demonstrates how to build a simple but flexible API using Express.js, handling dynamic data, and managing error handling effectively.
